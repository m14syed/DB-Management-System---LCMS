The Legal Case Management System (LCMS) uses a DataBase Management System
(DBMS) to manage a firm's case data, client information, documents, billing, and important
dates (i.e. court dates, document submission deadlines, legal time periods). The system is robust,
featuring several core functionalities alongside necessary querying and updating operations.
Relationships between data records are also contingent upon the system's success and are
outlined informally. Integrity constraints and User Roles and Interface Requirements are
included to ensure accessibility and ease of implementation.
